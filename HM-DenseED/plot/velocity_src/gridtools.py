def getNeighborship(G, kind="Geometrical", incBdry=False, nargout=1):
    """
    Retrieve neighborship relation ("graph") from grid.

    Synopsis:
        N, isnnc = getNeighborship(G, kind)

    Arguments:
        G (Grid):
            PRST grid object.

        kind (str):
            What kind of neighborship relation to extract. String. The
            following options are supported:

                - "Geometrical"
                    Extract geometrical neighborship relations. The geometric
                    connections correspond to physical, geometric interfaces
                    are are the ones listed in `G.faces.neighbors`.

                - "Topological"
                    Extract topological neighborship relations. In addition to
                    the geometrical relations  of "Geometrical" these possibly
                    include non-neighboring connections resulting from
                    pinch-out processing or explicit NNC lists in an ECLIPSE
                    input deck.

                    Additional connections will only be defined if the grid `G`
                    contains an `nnc` sub-structure.

        incBdry (bool):
            Flag to indicate whether or not to include boundary connections. A
            boundary connection is a connection in which one of the connecting
            cells is the outside (i.e., cell zero). Boolean. Default: False (Do
            NOT include boundary connections.)

        nargout (int):
            Set to 2 to return both N and isnnc. Default: Return only N.

    Returns:
        N (ndarray[int]):
            Neighborshop relation. An (m, 2)-shaped array of cell indices that
            form the connections--geometrical or otherwise. This array has
            similar interpretation to the field `G.faces.neighbors`, but may
            contain additional connections if kind="Topological".

        isnnc (ndarray[bool]):
            An (m, 1)-shaped boolean array indicating whether or not the
            corresponding connection (row) of N is a geometrical connection
            (i.e., a geometric interface from the grid `G`).

            Specifically, isnnc[i,0] is True if N[i,:] comes from a
            non-neighboring (i.e., non-geometrical) connection.

    Note:
        If the neighborship relation is later to be used to compute the graph
        adjacency matrix using function `getConnectivityMatrix`, then `incBdry`
        must be False.

def getCellNoFaces(G):
    """
    Get a list of all half faces, accounting for possible NNC.

    Synopsis:
        cellNo, cellFaces, isNNC = getCellNoFaces(G)

    Description:
        This utility function is used to produce a listing of all half faces in
        a grid along with the respective cells they belong to. While relatively
        trivial for most grids, this function specifically accounts for
        non-neighboring connections / NNC.

    Arguments:
        G (Grid):
            Grid structure with optional .nnc.cells attribute.

    Returns:
        cellNo (ndarray):
            Column array with shape (M,1) where M is the number of geometric
            half-faces + 2 * number of NNC, where each entry corresponds to
            cell index of that half face.

        cellFaces (ndarray):
            Column array with shape (M,1) with M as above, where each entry is
            the connection index. For the first entries, this is simply the
            face number. Otherwise, it is the entry of the NNC connection.
